# Distributed-mutex-algorithm-demo
The demo program simulates distributed mutex algorithm and token election algorithm respectively. The program is based on Qt Creator implementation, can dynamically interactive step-by-step demonstration of distributed classical algorithm execution process.

Demonstration effect:

The main interface:

Centralized mutex algorithm demo:(Random generation of program applications, the application of the execution of the program unified pressed into the waiting queue orderly execution.)

Distributed token elections demo:(The user can specify any program to request execution and use critical resources, but the program does not execute immediately after the request and waits for the token to pass before obtaining execution authority.)
